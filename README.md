The following are my solutions to the Case Study 7 Balanced Tree questions in 
[Danny Ma's Serious SQL course](https://www.datawithdanny.com/ "Data With Danny")
<br/>
<br/>
There are 4 [data tables](https://github.com/Shailesh-python/Case-Study-7-Balanced-Tree/blob/main/Data%20Sets) available to us in `balanced_tree` schema which we can use to run our SQL queries with:

1. `Product Details`

2. `Product Sales`

3. `Product Hierarcy`

4. `Product Price`
